# ext_pp
Small plugin based external text preprocessor that can introduce artificial static generics, different preprocessor keywords like #define #include #if and more to any kind of text file. Its main purpose is to keep me from copying my errors around when writing different opencl kernels.

You can find the documentation [HERE](https://bytechkr.github.io/ext-pp/)
